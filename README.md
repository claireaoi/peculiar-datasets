# Peculiar datasets

🚀👾🌵🗿 **Open call for peculiar datasets:** 🚀👾🌵🗿

the only banana left in the supermarket, summer bruises, error screens, broken hardrives, people falling asleep next to Harrari's books, Google translated t-shirts, elbows funks, whatever you feel attached to!
May it be quirky data, mundane data, engaged data, forgotten data, endangered data, neglected data, situated data, insignificant data, Object Oriented Ontologist data, etc.


### 🐧 Why ? 🐧
Data is there, everywhere around you and in your hand, in the technologies you rely on, in the algorithms which judge you in the emerging surveillance apparatus. It is obsessively- and often non consensualy-scraped, aggregated, measured, interpreted, and change the way we relate to the world, or to ourselves. Datasets, as the ML algorithms they power, are tangibly surfacing a certain worldview, and revealing some structures, dysfunctions or bias of our history and society. In times where the majority of pictures is created for machines, and Big Data outscale us in vaporous digital shadows, we, as individuals, often feel distant/alienated from these processes.

We want to deconstruct these visions of data-collection, datasets and the segmentation of the world they vehiculate. We want to switch from a massive & exploitative capitalistic data accumulation to a collective sharing amateur circle.
These handmade datasets could exist elsewhere, out of the capitalocene, in the inter and intra-personal, in the non-anthropocentred or in the mundane, and they would surface alternative narratives for the world.

🌈 Once a dataset, once a reality.🌈 

### 🐠 How ? 🐠
Via Github, or via email, reach us, and share your dataset with our Peculiar Data Circle.💫
It will soon be posted online, stay tuned! 
Any question, feedback, suggestion? We would be glad to hear from you !

This is an open source and participative project, launched summer 2019.
