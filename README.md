# Peculiar datasets

🚀👾🌵🗿 **Open call for peculiar datasets:** 🚀👾🌵🗿

the only banana left in the supermarket, summer bruises, error screens, broken hardrives, people falling asleep next to Harrari's books, Google translated t-shirts, elbows funks, whatever you feel attached to!
May it be quirky data, mundane data, engaged data, forgotten data, endangered data, neglected data, situated data, insignificant data, Object Oriented Ontologist data, etc.


### 🐧 Why ? 🐧
Data is there, everywhere around you and in your hand, in the technologies you rely on, in the algorithms which judge you in the emerging surveillance apparatus. It is obsessively- and often non consensualy-scraped, aggregated, measured, interpreted, and change the way we relate to the world, or to ourselves. Datasets, as the machine learning algorithms they power, are tangibly surfacing a certain worldview, and revealing some structures, dysfunctions or bias of our history and society. In times where the majority of pictures is created for machines, and Big Data wildy outscale us in vaporous digital shadows, we, as individuals, often feel alienated from these processes.

We want to deconstruct these visions of data collection, and the segmentation of the world they vehiculate. We want to switch from a massive & exploitative capitalistic data accumulation to a collective sharing amateur circle: a **Peculiar Data Circle**
Somehow, these handmade datasets are meant to exist elsewhere, out of the capitalocene, in the inter and intra-personal, in the non-anthropocentred, in the bizarre, or in the mundane, and to surface alternative narratives for our world.

Once a dataset, once a reality.🌈 

### 🐠 How ? 🐠
Via Github (here, pull request), or via email ( soundslike0003@gmail.com ), reach us, and share your dataset with our Peculiar Data Circle.💫
It will soon be posted online, stay tuned! 
Any question, feedback, suggestion? We would be glad to hear from you !

This is an open source and participative project, conceived as a civic reappropriation of datasets, launched summer 2019.
